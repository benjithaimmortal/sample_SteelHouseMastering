      <strong>Stem Mastering</strong><br>
      Stem mastering is in between mixing and mastering. If you're not confident in your final mix, stem mastering may be your ticket. Send us the groups and busses (drums, guitars, keys, bass, vocals, ect.) Stem Mastering gives more control to your final representation and mix.
