      <h2>We make music, just like you do.</h2>
      <p>
        Music isn't just a profession, it's my lifeblood. 
        It flows and surrounds me in everyday life. 
        With 15 years of experience, I have spent a good chunk 
        of that time honing my craft and art, playing gigs, 
        and extending my knowledge on all things music and audio related. 
        Therefore, I understand what your music means to you. 
        I know the hardships of playing in bands, venues that 
        don't pay fairly, and struggling to get your music to the masses.

      <h2>A Musician, Engineer, and Producer</h2>
      <p>
        I'm Brandon Allshouse, owner and chief engineer of
        Steel House Studio. Priding myself on hard work and a
        willingness to go above and beyond, I'm confident you will
        feel welcome and be satisfied with your completed project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Half of my life I've been involved with various audio projects,
        bands, and gigs, constantly bettering myself in the process.
        Surrounding myself with like minded individuals is key, and
        learning from others is success. I hope through your business,
        we forge a business relationship and friendship.

        Here at Steel House Studio, mastering is a big part of what we do.
        But we also mix and edit, tune vocals, sample replace, have a
        complete recording setup, as well as teach mixing lessons and
        can consult on home studio startups.
